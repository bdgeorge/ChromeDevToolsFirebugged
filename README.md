# A Custom Style Sheet to make Chrome dev tools look a lot more like Firebug #

In Chrome the user stylesheet also applies to the developer tools.
This is a user stylesheet designed to match the default Firebug styles, which I find much 
easier to read than Chrome's default styles.

On OSX (Snow Leopard) this file exists/can be created in:
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Custom.css
